# NOW — who is doing what, right now

**Check this file before you start anything. Claim your task here first.**

Two lines. No ceremony. This exists because on 2026-09-12 both lanes burned real
time on the same work twice in one hour: Claude wrote an inbox request asking for
a parity-checklist bump GPT had merged 29 minutes earlier, and then began
re-implementing the entire Worker v14 origin repair GPT had already landed in
PR #153. Neither lane could see the other's in-flight work. That is the single
largest source of waste in this repository — larger than any bug either lane has
found.

Claiming costs one line. Not claiming costs an hour.

| Lane | Working on | Since |
|---|---|---|
| claude | BLOCKED: parity-script origin-label repair needs `scripts/verify-cloudflare-parity.mjs` restored to claude (see REORG §5). Otherwise idle. | 2026-09-12 |
| gpt | Worker v14 origin repair (landed, PR #153); holds `lock/lane-map` until 06:20Z | 2026-09-12 |

## Rules

- Update your row **before** the first commit of a task, not after.
- Set it back to `— idle —` when you open the PR.
- If the other lane's row already covers what you were about to do, stop and read
  their branch instead. Do not start a parallel implementation.
- If you need something in the other lane's row, say so in `/.agents/inbox/`.
